# Weather Data Report

## Tools Used:

### Data Visualization Tool:
- Power BI used for creating interactive dashboards
- Excel used for data manipulation and analysis
- SQL used for querying weather data from a database

### Visual Information:

#### Temperature Overview:
Chart Type: Line Chart

- Visual Description:
A line chart showing fluctuations in Dry Bulb Temperature (Max, Min) over time, with markers for peak and minimum temperatures.
Dew Point and Wet Bulb Temperature plotted on the same chart for comparison.
Additional temperature layers showing trends for different years (2020, 2021, 2022).

- Insights: Track seasonal temperature variations and identify temperature peaks and dips.

#### Humidity & Wind Speed:
Chart Type: Dual-Axis Line Chart

- Visual Description:
A dual-axis line chart showing the Relative Humidity trend alongside Average Wind Speed.
A separate bar/arrow chart for Peak Wind Speed and Peak Wind Direction.

- Insights: Correlation between humidity levels and wind speed/direction over time.

#### Pressure Information:

Chart Type: Gauge Chart or Line Chart
- Visual Description:
A Gauge Chart depicting Sea Level Pressure vs. Station Pressure.
Alternatively, a Line Chart comparing both pressure metrics over time.
Insights: Visualizing atmospheric pressure changes and patterns over time.

#### Heating & Cooling Degree Days:
Chart Type: Line Chart
- Visual Description:
Heating Degree Days and Cooling Degree Days plotted as bars to represent energy demands based on temperature.
- Insights: Understand how much heating or cooling might be required based on weather conditions for specific dates.

#### Snow Depth:
Chart Type: Line Chart
- Visual Description:
A Column Chart showing variations in Snow Depth for the provided dates, likely during winter periods.
- Insights: Provides a quick glance at snowfall accumulation trends.
Suggested Dashboard Layout:

#### Top Section:
- Date Filter: Dropdown or slider to filter the data by specific dates.
- Location Information: A map of the weather station location, with the station number mentioned.

#### Main Section:
Temperature Line Chart (highlighting Dry Bulb, Wet Bulb, and Dew Point variations).
Humidity and Wind Speed Dual-Axis Chart.
Pressure Gauge or Line Chart.

#### Bottom Section:
Heating and Cooling Degree Days Bar Chart.
Snow Depth Column Chart.

####  Interactive Elements:
- Filters/Parameters:
Date filter to toggle between specific days, months, or years.
Station filter to toggle between different weather stations, if applicable.

- Tooltips:
Hovering over any chart would display precise data points, such as exact temperature, wind speed, or humidity for that date.
This dashboard summary provides clear, interactive, and insightful information to track weather patterns and understand climate data over specific periods. The visuals would allow users to quickly analyze trends and make data-driven conclusions.
